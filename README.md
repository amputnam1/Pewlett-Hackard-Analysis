# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


**1. Overview of the analysis: The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.** 
In this assignment there is information determining the number of retiring employees per title as well as identifying employees who are elibile to participate in the mentopship program within the company Pewlett Hackardx. The report provides summarizes my analysis and will help prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" as well as current employees whose they reach retirement age.

**2. Results: There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables**

In analyzing the results I collected list of the employees who were at an age being ready for retirement, potential retirees from spcecific detpartments, as well as department managers. 

Thre results were aggregateing in a query method for the product that showed that there is indeed a silver tsunami that is emininent in the short-term future. <img width="238" alt="retiring_titles" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93094173/163411407-f9f7e6b0-0c02-4ba8-9e9c-87db4435d988.png">

Results indicate that the majority of employees who are retining soon are of the title of:
- Senior Staff - 31%
- Senior Engineers at 33%:
- 90,398 employees are going to retire from the company.
- There are 1,549 employes who qualify for them mentorship being offered\.

**3. Summary: The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight**

The findings of this analysis based on the information from the combined CSV data indicates that there are likely about 90,398 employees who will be retiring within a year. This will require significant planning and conversations with upper level management and the CEO to determine an appropriate course of action, organizational preparation in order to fill positions that will be vacant and loss of talent in the coming year and beyond. 

Given the deep dive analysis we can also infer that that the departments with the greater attrition due to retiremene are Production and Development departments.

The findings about salary show that the largest salary is within 1. Development, 2. Sales, and 3. Production. Due to this large amount of money this could be savings but also potential investments in new hires, mentorship and training and development progreams, job shadowing current employees/soon-to-be retireees to set the company up for success moving forward despite loss of tenured talent.
